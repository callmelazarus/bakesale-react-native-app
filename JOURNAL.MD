## Nov 29, 2022 - Tuesday

**Today I worked on:**

- Staring up application
- learned how to create repo's on github and push local files to it
- built out basic fetch calls again (async, await)

**Reflection:**

- coding something usable has made coding fun again :)

**Lesson:**

- these video tutorials take so much more time than I would expect. It may be good to anticipate 1 hour in video form = 3 hours in practice.

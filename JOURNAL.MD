**Today I worked on:**
worked on animations
fixed some bugs
learned about icons and splash screens
learned about deployment

**Reflection:**
I was derailed, the devops stuff took up nearly 2 hours of my time this afternoon. That is just how it goes sometimes, but instead, I learned more about configurations, making sure I read thru the docs (which was important that I installed the right dependencies).

**Lesson:**
read the docs man! from top to bottom. it will save you time in the long run.

VIM editing tools - there are many shortcuts in how to navigate the VIM

`source` keyword refreshes a file
`cat` keyword allows you to inspect a file

**Today I worked on:**
Finishing the BakeSale application (took about 3.5 hours for a 1 hour video tutorial)

**Reflection:**
Getting back into it, and it looks like bakesale now works!
On press functionality is a combination of state setting, and funcitons

**Lesson:**
Debouncing -> ensures code fires only one time per input (search boxes, text-field autosaves, and eliminating double clipes are all use cases for debounce)

**Today I worked on:**

- selected Yelp API in lue of of the broken bakesale api the tutorial is built on.
- having PROBLEMS with the authorization, despite me putting in the right key.

**Reflection:**
Yelp API docs
https://docs.developer.yelp.com/reference/v3_business_search

My API for the app I'm buidling
https://www.yelp.com/developers/v3/manage_app?app_created=True

**Lesson:**

- make sure you have the right file names in the gitignore file
- hitting these roadblocks really do suck, but need to have the right attitude and strategy about them

## Nov 29, 2022 - Tuesday

**Today I worked on:**

- Staring up application
- learned how to create repo's on github and push local files to it
- built out basic fetch calls again (async, await)

**Reflection:**

- coding something usable has made coding fun again :)

**Lesson:**

- these video tutorials take so much more time than I would expect. It may be good to anticipate 1 hour in video form = 3 hours in practice.

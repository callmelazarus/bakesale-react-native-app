Getting back into it, and it looks like bakesale now works!

**Lesson:**


## Nov 30, 2022 - Wed

**Today I worked on:**

- selected Yelp API in lue of of the broken bakesale api the tutorial is built on.
- having PROBLEMS with the authorization, despite me putting in the right key.

**Reflection:**
Yelp API docs
https://docs.developer.yelp.com/reference/v3_business_search

My API for the app I'm buidling
https://www.yelp.com/developers/v3/manage_app?app_created=True

**Lesson:**

- make sure you have the right file names in the gitignore file
- hitting these roadblocks really do suck, but need to have the right attitude and strategy about them

## Nov 29, 2022 - Tuesday

**Today I worked on:**

- Staring up application
- learned how to create repo's on github and push local files to it
- built out basic fetch calls again (async, await)

**Reflection:**

- coding something usable has made coding fun again :)

**Lesson:**

- these video tutorials take so much more time than I would expect. It may be good to anticipate 1 hour in video form = 3 hours in practice.
